                            <p> The /warp mine is where everyone goes to get money. Since everyone is going there, an average of 4 - 7 people are there at once. That means the ores will be mined within 3 minutes. 3 minutes for 4 people to try and make some money is not a lot of time. My request: make the mine a LOT bigger. Maybe an extra 5 - 10 blocks on each side. Also, the reset should be quicker. For some reason, it takes forever to reset. Let me know you opionon on this request. Thanks, Bronco. I plan to use Trickster for the free casts. The move speed bonus also synergises well with LW. I haven't really made a hybrid life/ES/EV build before so I'm not sure if I got enough of each. Auras: Grace, Discipline, Wrath Gear: Queen of the Forest, Alpha's Howl, EV or EV/ES bases Tree: What do you guys think. Hey all, I was recently looking at trickster mine build for lightning warp mines, if anyone knows why does the build use mines instead of traps? I feel like traps would be a little safer since you can throw them, but I could be wrong. I have quite the amount of time in POE but have never played a trap or mine build. If anyone has some info itd be awesome if you could share. Thank you, Have a great. >The scattered worlds of the Elara's Veil nebula were once protected by the oath of unity sworn by three mighty Chapters of the Adeptus Astartes. The Star Scorpions were undone by flaws in their genetic coding. The Celestial Lions were ravaged by the Inquisition for sins they did not commit. Now, after hundreds of years, only the Emperor's Spears still keep their vigil. They are barbarian watchmen against the Outer Dark; bloodied but unbroken in their long duty. >Amadeus Kaias Incarius I fucked up. Forgot to put locktite on my front caliper after installing my speedo, and it came off today at the very end of a riding session. Went over the handlebars and broke my new trailtech vapor, have a nice tread mark on my stomach from my rear tire. One bolt to my caliper came out the the rest is history. The remaining bolt was very bent when I removed it. Everything seems to line up fine except for the rotor which is very bent. I'm having trouble finding a replacement rotor, atleast. I believe that when the game is calculating the amount of minerals mined while idle/warp it is not calculating correctly. Test 1: Control: when active I have enough input of copper from mines to support 3 copper refineries with surplus. Idle x1hour: copper refineries depleat copper reserves despite expected surplus. Time warp x1hour: same results as idle. Test 2: ran a second test with iron and 1 iron refinery. Results exactly the same.

Hello Interlopers! This is a Bi-Weekly Megathread for the purpose of posting any questions you may have about the game, and receive answers from the community! --- - Keep it civil. Subreddit rules apply - Please only submit questions you have about the game --- Ask away, Interlopers!. Has anyone ever have a pelican case warp? Mine specifically is a 1495, but I am more curious about it being an issue in general. I can close/open the latches, but I have a problem when i try to open the locking mechanism. I have to press down on the top of the case for the catch to release off the lock. Worth sending in for replacement. Does Scopely have an official plan to fix the vast quantity of broken missions? I have a quest log full of relatively impossible to complete missions. They’re broken due to ridiculously bad scaling. Defeat a 2.5 million strength battleship for 20k fed faction rep? Lol. No. Go visit this person on x planet for 15k rep? By the way need warp 70. It’s garbage. 75% of my missions are stuck on 3/4 or 4/5 steps because of ridiculous targets. I’m lvl 30. I can’t spend 0,000 to complete a mission.

You should take a look at this." Phrax sighed and rubbed his eyes, and for a moment, he just let the chatter of the command room wash over him before he engaged his grav-chair and navigated down the aisle to where the comms specialist was gesturing at him urgently. It was nearly fifty years later. "What's this?". </p>
