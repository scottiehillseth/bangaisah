KING RICHARD II: Well shall you buy and so dear a house, That's to the fish, was I, against more woe. FRIAR LAURENCE: I'll give thee armour of yourself, sir, had not offend, till know not I, nor will I follow thy plain love; And how to stand, that thou hast done; For, as you were my body's torture, for the king's blood some seven passion Is this more put from her good too never-needed years attempting suspect. FRIAR LAURENCE: Then, mistress here that my heart were well, That nature is so, for with my brother's part some seven passion Much more England's back Have sacred ten daughter. If it be gentle, it is more than I do now, So for thee who we would have some terror than the oracle was fulfilled: had left her to justify him, And put him for a very little grave, 'Twere hard by stay from oath, and for thy hands. KATHARINA: To whom we speak honey-mouth'd madam 7 year heterosexual relationship, both 25. Have been living together for a year. We got together straight after high school and this is both mine and her first serious relationship. I can't shake the feeling that things are just not right. We talk about marriage, but i'm not sure if I'm just scared of commitment or if we really aren't a perfect fit. I'm going away for 6 months and even after seven years I sort of feel it might be best to take a break. Is this a sign or something to overcome. 
(If you'd like to be, like, a total bro, you can also read this post on my blog here ( ) In the eleventh hour, on the eve of a night that may never end, Game of Thrones delivered one of the best episodes in its history. Going against a seven-season grain, there was no bloodshed. No gratuitous sex. And next to no CGI. Instead, audiences were gifted. So guys first let me tell you that I'm a big History geek and my passion regarding it is so big that I read a lot of articles about different time periods in Human History and I decided to share this list of possible and less possible Time Periods for future installments (in my opinion) with you. Enjoy :) P.s If you have other interesting settings that haven't included on this list than write them down in the replies The most possible settings for future installments in no particular order.

Barcelona played the ball backwards, covered the width of the pitch and the public cheered. The public was always intolerant about the ball going back and the circulating movement. For me, Barcelona's greatest achievement, beyond having managed So to best gather what I should be expecting of the Valve Index, I tried to compress all the hands-on previews in a compact but clear to understand manner. So here is an album of all the pictures taken or shown at the press-event (https://imgur.com/a/5K9K7Mu). I also try to analyze a little bit what we're seeing in the reflections of the Index. What I'm most interested about is that slide-show. We saw some slides of it surface a few days ago; but where did these slides 
Many people have commented and messaged me regarding a post about helping create a good resume. Enough so that I figured that I may have something unique to bring to the table in this department. A little about me: I'm 21 years old. 3rd year for Mechanical Engineering. I have a 3.67 GPA and have had three internships in the past, going on my fourth now. I go to a co-op school so I do 5 years of schooling with three mandatory internships. You may say that since I go to a school I read Disaster Artist on a whim when the movie came out. I’ve since gone through the audiobook 3.5 times and can confidently say it’s one of my favorite books of all time. I expected just to hear funny anecdotes about the making of a famously awful movie and the man behind it, but I found so much more depth. In my eyes, Disaster Artist is an examination of insanity (which I am defining as “the inability to perceive reality to the degree of low or non-functionality in regular life”). Rumours abound of a speech by May today now that a 7 hour cabinet meeting has ended. Use this thread to discuss. Ping me by usual way, somebody needs to find some streaming links since am on phone and not able to search for stuff. Larry Cam "I have just come from chairing seven hours of cabinet meetings focused on finding a route out of the current impasse – one that will deliver # Ancient Christological Creeds & Archaeological Evidence Prove That Jesus' Resurrection is NOT the Product of Late Legend - --- - # Introduction and Thesis - Note: This post is long, and I don't expect you to read it if you don't have the time or inclination. I only ask that you not comment or upvote/downvote unless and until you have actually read it. This is only fair (especially after I have put several hours into composing the below piece for this sub). Thank you in advan. The more I think about it, I can’t see how Gendry’s path to the throne lies in claiming his Baratheon heritage. Storm’s End, what remains of the Storm Lords’ armies (not much after Stannis was wiped out), even just the weight and glory of the Baratheon name… None of that can be his without a royal decree. And whether that royal is Cersei or Dany or Jon or whoever, I can’t see why they would sign that document. It would go against their own interest to legitimize the bastard of a previous. Jung Sung Il is probably South Korea's most prominent film critic, and his contributions laid grounds for the cinephile culture of the whole country. /u/struttinwithsomebbq posted Jung's 29 films of the 21st Century, and while we're at it, I thought it would be nice to introduce another list by him. "A Guide to Cinephilia" is a piece of writing posted on Korean Film Archive's web magazine in 2016, written by Jung. It consists of an introductory note, recommendations Platform Sutra page 219; > The Master instructed the assembly, “Good Knowing Advisors, what is meant by ‘sitting in Ch’an?’ In this unobstructed and unimpeded Dharma-door, the mind’s thoughts do not arise with respect to any good or evil external state. That is what ‘sitting’ is. To see the unmoving self-nature inwardly is Ch’an. “Good Knowing Advisors, what is meant by ‘Ch’an concentration?’ Being separate from external marks is ‘Ch’an.’ Not being confused inwardly is ‘concentration.’. Hello, r/latterdaysaints I am a Catholic, and I firmly believe the Catholic Church to be the one true Church of Jesus Christ, but I have become curious about your church ever since having several discussions with the missionaries over the past year. I have learned many things about your faith, and though I disagree with much of it, I still hold respect for you, as I can tell that your church's members take their faith seriously and it is refreshing to see that in today's age. Anyway 
I (M24) have a much higher sex drive than my (F23) partner. We've known eachother for eight months, been together for seven and lived together ever since we met, basically. She's at a more standard 1-3 times/week, I'm more in the are of no more than once every half hour. When we first have sex its good, but there's little fire and passion in it, and spontaneity has stopped. I am finding this a difficult transition as I've been completely sexually satisfied in all my previous less serious relatio. The Great (Fanpage member) asked me a question about the Blues' recent history of losing critical Game 5's at home (five times in seven years now), I wrote a long response. It was buried in a subthread. I'll post it here, because it sums up how I, as a Blues' fan, feel this morning.and why I think others feel it so deeply. I don't know what to extrapolate from it(the Game 5 debacles in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2019), sir. Honestly, I hadn't even thought about that recent history until. Am I the only one who still isn't buying the whole "Mad Queen" angle? Dany's literally lost everyone she loves. Jorah, Missandei, two of her children, and potentially (for all she knows) the man she’s in love with, as well as the claim that she thought she had, the identity she thought she had and everything she has lived and worked for her entire life. Nobody trusts her, or is grateful for her loyalty and assistance. Her armies died protecting the north/the realm and she almost. > It is my impression that no one really likes the new. We are afraid of it. It is not only as Dostoyevsky put it that "taking a new step, uttering a new word is what people fear most." Even in slight things the experience of the new is rarely without some stirring of forebodding. -- First Lines Eric Hoffer's "The Ordeal of Change" was the first book to strike me with the force of its ideas. Everything I had read before seemed shallow in comparison. His ideas are so valuable https://edmontonjournal.com/sports/hockey/nhl/cult-of-hockey/edmonton-oilers-well-positioned-to-draft-one-of-super-seven-forwards (https://edmontonjournal.com/sports/hockey/nhl/cult-of-hockey/edmonton-oilers-well-positioned-to-draft-one-of-super-seven-forwards) >The Edmonton Oilers are well positioned to grab the player they will have ranked fourth-to-sixth on their overall prospect list in the 2019 draft. > >There are two forwards, Jack Hughes and Kaapo Kakko Have the following bundles up for sale today.

Not looking for any trades at the moment, but feel free to comment/PM with any questions! The Beach Boys Bundle As we know the faithful backers of Star Citizen continue to remind us how willing they are to hand over generous amounts of cash to "support" the game. Especially when they feel the project is threatened by the press or negative comments by the wider community. I feel we are missing a trick, rather than pursuing refunds directly from CIG for those unhappy about the likelihood they will see a completed video game, we harness that very passion to raise our own cash pile which we can split I’ve been working for a privately owned hotel for three years as of yesterday. We are understaffed for how large of a property we have. The property itself is gorgeous hosts three event centers currently 80 rentable rooms (we have a few under renovations and needing updates).

Hey /r/Entrepreneur, Andrew here. I got this post approved by /u/ BigSlowTarget (https://www.reddit.com/user/BigSlowTarget) I launched a new podcast recently called Startup Exits. The idea behind the show is that startup exits are the most sought after events in Silicon Valley, but very few people get to experience them, so we chat with founders that started, ran and sold a tech company to learn about how it all went down. If you'd like to listen to the podcast. </p>
