Kind of struggling with whether I want to delve super deep into the series after all these years. Edit: Thanks So maybe I’m late to the game here but has anyone else noticed that the books which have “loosely” fed a lot of Neverwinter’s storyline are no longer being released? The last Forgotten Realm DampD book was published in 2016.which is not typical at all. (R.A. Salvatore’s Hero).
