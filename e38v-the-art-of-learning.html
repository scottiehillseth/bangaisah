                            <p> Does anyone have any advice for someone who wants to read more about Asian mysticism as discussed This is a transcript for a video summary, so please forgive any grammatical issues :). ABOUT THE AUTHOR Josh is an extremely accomplished individual; he's a chess prodigy who became an International Master at the age of 16, and then went on to became a world champion in competitive martial arts. He's gotten really good at getting really good at things and he wrote this book to share some of the sort of Jedi mind-tricks that he's learned over the years. It's an amazing book that treats especially the psychological aspects of winning, and its insane how much i can relate to a chest and tai-chi master thanks to a silly video. Promo Video: The Art of Learning (https://youtu.be/lj1gxz5puaQ) I've just finished listening to this extremely inspirational audio book I would love to share with you all. It's about Josh Waitzkin, an American chess player born in 1976 who is the #1 rated player in the US(For his age) for most of his teens. As a young adult he loses his passion for chess and begins martial arts. Specifically "Taiji Push Hands" where he goes on to become World Champion. Josh discusses his path from beginner. 
Not just in chess in general, but was it practical life advice? Did it teach you how to better learn things. Deliberate Practice and Starcraft: Brood War Pedagogy Disclaimer : Starcraft is fun. We play for fun. This writing will not apply to everyone, is not the only way to play the game, and is aimed at people who probably do not exist: the ones who want to be the best and are willing to do what it takes. Beyond that, it is just a musing on how to apply deliberate practice to fields without established pedagogical principles. Also, this is from the context of Brood War, the Starcraft Hi everyone, I've just completed a lengthy written tutorial about the inventory system that I designed for the game I'm developing. It contains the in-depth thought process behind the design choices I made, as well as plenty of example code to walk you through the process of implementing an inventory system in GameMaker Studio. It's the first tutorial I've written, and I'd love to get some feedback on it. I hope someone will find it useful! http://thru-the-trees.com/designnotes-1-the-art-of-le. Coming up on my 3 year anniversary of finding this place and wanted to start giving back. Thank you to everyone in this community. Went from begging for sex on my 10 year wedding anniversary & then crying about it to her– lowest point of my life- to her telling me that her “pussy is all mine” on my 11th anniversary as I’m choking her doggie style. Mmslp/mrp completely changed my life around. Thank you. Just read the, “The Art of Learning: An Inner Journey to Optimal Performance” I had to read this book for an acting class and truly, it's changed my life. Something tells me Josh Waitzkin is an ENFP (or maybe something similar, I'm not a pro at this, pretty new to it)! Reading his insights about his thought processes when he was just 7 or 8 years old, becoming the best chess player in the country, and the world, and really detailing his journey, the struggles. It clicked ###Intro I understand that PC MOBAs are more older and have a larger community, especially in regards to content creators, but as a community we need to start being more proactive with what other MOBAs seem to excel at. Broken Myth ( has been leading the way with creating content for Vainglory. SEMC need to do way more in offering visuals similar to what @taxitisamba ( offers (I'm in desperate search of a HD quality </p>
