Here.you.can.play.a.ton.of.fun.  Hey all! Long time lurker, first time poster. I love all of these stories and have been wracking my brain trying to remember something I could post here - and I think I’ve finally got one! I’ll post a TL;DR at the end as well - this will be long because I’m wordy and have no self-control. A few years ago, my ex and I rented a one-bedroom house on a dead-end street in the downtown area of the city I grew up in. We had three cats and I lived close enough to my job that I could 
Just as I was about to unsubscribe to his Snapchat, J came on and SPILLED the TEA about what’s been happening online. THE VIEWERS VOICE (https://youtu.be/4JHxsVrN63Q) JUST UPLOADED IT HERE YA GO Ashlye Kyle just did her video (https://youtu.be/jRE2BRtmHFk) The comment sections on both are interesting. TLDL: Basically, J gave excuses for everything, showed himself as more of a hypocrite and as horrible as JC, Gabby and Nikita in the sense of being a manipulative, narcissistic, hot-head. Background: Got married 15 years ago when we were 21 years old as virgins, have always had a weekly sex life but fairly lackluster with low interest on her part. We both thought that’s just how she was. Then six weeks ago, she told me she’s developed intense attraction for someone else and wants to open up our marriage to explore this side of herself. I deliberated then said no, she agreed and cut contact, but also said now she didn’t know if we have a future and she’s pessimistic You can find my prior posts Here (https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/a7xjx3/destroy_my_childhood_ruin_my_chance_at_college/) and Here (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/asvoir/my_m25_extremely_abusive_mother_f45_fled_the/). I'd also like to thank @Slazo aka Emkay on Youtube for sharing a Gofundme I forgot about and sharing my story in one of his video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBmpaNtMVeU)s! You were really kind. Also i'd like to thank. First of all, Slash and any of you clickbait generating websites.you do NOT have permission to use this post in any way. This post is for the enjoyment and entertainment of the subreddit's readers, not for you parasites to try to monetize the writing of others. Eat a bag of dicks, the lot of you. Here’s a way I used malicious compliance to get paid for doing nothing for the next year, while dedicating my efforts to the success of the competitors of the people who are paying ###Compilation of leakers who have given accurate details from episodes. All these leakers gave information before the episodes aired; --- Update May 16. Update on episode 6 from compilation of leaks from r/freefolk and the cleganebowl leaker who gave accurate information (over what was stated by other leakers) for episode 5. We have to trust that cgmcnama is certain this is the same guy since we have no direct information previously. Jon, Davos and Tyrion are walking through the after. So this happened yesterday and I'm crying with anger and a lot of uncontrolled emotions. Bit of a background first, last year got married and my wife got me a puppy as we both were dog lovers, he stole our hearts the very same day and was the apple of our eyes ever since. 4 months ago Wife died in a road freak accident and left us both to gather the pieces of our shattered life. My brave dog helped me through all of it despite himself suffering and searching for her everyday in all the rooms. For some Context: Back in Elementary, Our teacher told us that there were two kinds of Push-ups that you could do, there were "Normal Push-ups" which were the only ones us guy's were allowed to do during PT, and "Assisted" (Or as She called them "Girl Push-ups") which were the ones that she recommended the Girls of our class to start out with. because this was a rather small town out in dairy farm country, terms like this tended to stick with you even into later in High school. This is important. 
Hi. My name is Emily. Most days, I would rather eat hot coals than do something that would send my husband Dennis into one of his rages. Like using his laptop. But I’m doing it. My husband says I’m stupid. Maybe I am. But I figured out how to create an account on Reddit. Despite the terror making my fingers shake and my heart stutter… I’m determined to tell someone what happened, even if it’s an anonymous group of people on the Internet. It’s rare that I’m alone. Dennis works from home. Compute. i already posted this on another subreddit, but i thought i should post it here too also: EB: Entitled bitch teacher for some background info, every school year, all of the students in my school that are in the music department get to go on a trip to an amusement park, this year being Hershey Park. However, there are certain requirements to maintain eligibility. this is listed in the music agreement. the requirements are: a) you attend both concerts (with the exception of excused absences). Another work story It was a completely regular shift except for one thing: I needed to shit. I didn’t need to until I was driving to work so there was nothing I could do. I always try and prevent myself from the #2 during work because we have one 15 minute break and I don’t like wasting it. Also, Harris Teeter bathrooms are definitely not elegant or newly furnished. After a few hours of trying to wait it out, I couldn’t take it any longer. I excused myself from my register and asked my manage. New to reddit so please be gentle with me if i'm doing this wrong, first real post here, been reading silently for a while. Sorry it's very long. So this happened a long time ago, more than 2 decades as you can see by the title, but it still sticks in my memory, even among the many crazy things that happened that night and that week even. Not everyone had cell phones yet, though lots of people did. This will matter later.The storm was intense, it was alternating between heavy. TW: sexual abuse Sent the email this morning. I personally haven't heard a word from JNMIL. DH on the other hand. Let's just say it's gone as well as most of you predicted. She's denying any wrong doing, of course. JNMIL has forwarded my email (or some version of it anyway) to FIL, BIL, and SIL edit: + AIL  Good!! The more people that see it the better. BIL and SIL are saying the email was too personal. I'm now the bad guy for writing a personal email to her about her personal. 
So, one or two of you guys wanted me to write the second part of this. Well, you got me. Here’s Part 1 (https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/bfbypk/ed_tries_to_ruin_the_movie_claiming_our_food_as/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app) if you haven’t read it yet. Be warned, English is my 43nd language, this is written with sticks and mud, and I’m on my first martini, shaken not stirred. Cast: OP/Me: Peter Parker F: Friend EK: Entitled Demon’s Spawn EM: Entitled Demon’s. A few years ago my father died. He and I weren’t on the best of terms at all times, but he was my father and I still love him dearly. This story involves my little brother (LB), my dads girlfriend (GF), my mother, my dads biological mother (Bio Mom) and my entitled ass grandparents (EGF and EGM) for grandfather and grandmother. My dad is actually my step dad, so not biologically related, but you know the deal. My dad was a super simple man. He would have loved for his service My earliest memory was watching the movie Monsters, Inc. and thinking it was the coolest that my mother looked like Sulley. That, of course, wasn’t her real form, but the one she used to avoid both scaring me and putting too much strain on her body. You could say she was somewhat a shapeshifter, but she couldn’t choose freely how to look like. We lived in a small rural property, with high walls to avoid catching the eye of intruders and passersby. Just me, Mother Sulley – that’s how I called. I found this subreddit on my YouTube recommendation list so I want to share my own story. It is quite long so I hope you'll stick to the end. If this is petty revenge, do tell me. A few background information before I get into the story. I am a bastard child, child born out of wedlock, but I am not the only one. I have a fraternal twin brother, we'll call him Dill. When my mother and father, who were both 25 at the time, found out they were having twins 
(Orginally posted on r/entitledpeople but it matches here too) Now to explain what's happened and why I'm called this word. I have Autism. I'm on the exact dot of between high and middle. So sometimes I'm easily distracted by things and have hairline anger triggers. This was when I was a kid mind you. The first 2 are when I was a child. The 3rd one happened when I was 18 and working my first job. Onto the fuck uppery. !1st Mistake! Now I don't remember this. But my mother had experience. Personally, I know that when you’re to the point of making pros and cons lists, the relationship is probably over, but I need to write this out somewhere and get some clarity. I desperately want to salvage it because he’s the love of my life and he has all the potential in the world. Some Pros: •Puts others before himself. He’ll give someone his last dollar no matter if it sets him back. I like how he isn’t materialistic. •Loyal, I’ve never seen him check out another girl in three years. </p>
