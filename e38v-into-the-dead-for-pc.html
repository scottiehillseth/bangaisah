                            <p> Patch 9 arrives today, bringing a host of new Wild Appalachia content to Fallout 76, including new features, quests, challenges, balance adjustments, and a ton of bug fixes. Read on to catch the full patch notes for today’s update. --- ### Patch Highlights - Ever Upwards: Join the Pioneer Scouts to complete new Quests, Challenges, an Event, and receive your first Backpack. - Backpacks: Equip a Backpack to increase your carry weight, then apply mods to customize its appearance (Important) edit: A lot of people are feeling discouraged for their first runs after reading this, so see this as a disclaimer. NOT EVERY GROUP IS LIKE THIS. There are some Sherpas where the stars align and everything works out perfectly. And to all the new people that want to do their first run, but are afraid to go do lfg because of XY reason. Discord: Breeze#5440 I am a PC player. Message me. Talk to me, we'll get a group together and we'll demolish Riven. lt3 K back to the shitpostery. 
I wanted a megathread on this, but the sister scandal has overshadowed a lot of stuff. As the title suggests, I want a thread with all beauty gurus who use ( or have restarted using) KvD. I will try to find proofs of these claims so will be editting this comment a lot. Edit: majority of these are those who are actively promoting KvD ( including Ali Andrea, e.g who's a pro-muA), but if you feel someone is listed here who is just trying to finish up an existing stash and not actively promoting. Game Information -------------------- Game Title : A Plague Tale: Innocence Platforms : - PlayStation 4 (May 13, 2019) - Xbox One (May 13, 2019) - PC (May 13, 2019) Trailers : - A Plague Tale: Innocence - ampquot;Monstersampquot; Trailer (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjjbrmD1Rg4) - A Plague Tale: Innocence - Overview Gameplay Trailer (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7Jj_G425yU) - A Plague Tale: Innocence - Uncut Gameplay Trailer (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w-k5iSc. Alright so this just happened a few days ago, I will try to keep it mostly PG but it was one of the strangest tripping experience I have ever had. About 6 weeks ago I purchased a k high end sex doll. I've been single for along time since my Fiance and I split, long enough that the thought of having sex giving me anxiety, I really don't want to perform poorly. I felt having something to actually practice on again would be good for me before going back into the wild. These things Hello Survivors! We have just released the third Platform Update of DayZ on Steam (both the game update and server files update). The 1.03 update features new ways to use your firearms, along with several quality of life improvements and some nice tacticool touches like the ability to attach the NVGs and the Universal Flashlight to your Tactical Helmet, or two brand new belt models! Get all the details and full patch notes below! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHQtj6vXe6Q (https://www.youtu. First off, I think it's important to note that we were in this exact position almost 3 years ago regarding the current discussion (https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/5bbsaf/cozmo_has_acknowledged_the_desire_for_a_primary/d9nbxta?utm_source=shareamputm_medium=web2x). Iirc, the thread was even stickied. I think it's important to point this out because it really does emphasize a lot about the history of the discussion, and how it's been very cyclical in nature. Anyways, while. Last night I sat down to play a bit more of NV as I knew I was nearing the end and only had the last half on Lonesome Road and then the last mission left. Next thing I know it's 3am and I just finished watching the ending cutscenes. This is definitely one of my favorite games and easily top ten. I'll share some thoughts I had with yall. amp#x200B; The Good Main Story - I loved the storyline and how they intertwined the personal plot with Benny and the Courier up into a huge regional confl. 
This isn't a happy post, I'm sorry. I don't even know if the mods are going to allow this. But I feel like typing it out is going to help, so even if it gets removed I'll hopefully feel a bit better. My friend's death was published months ago, so giving his name shouldn't be a problem. His name was Alex. He and I met when I was at language school for the Air Force, and while we didn't really hang out much at first, by the time we both got stationed in Hawaii we had a lot of mutual friends. Hey guys, I've compiled a list of all games exclusive to the epic game store so you know what games to avoid. I've also added a reason if I could find one (Outer Worlds being exclusive is not the fault of Obsidian, for example). Doesn't mean you should buy it if there is a reason, but just an explanation. I think I got most of it, if not everything. If I missed something, let me know and I'll add it. Title Duration Reason Relevant sources :- :- :- :- Afterparty timed exclusive Ancest. Sometimes you want to go where everybody has a name amp#x200B; Every GM knows the joke: The players ignore the NPC with the ! above their head and gravitate to the one person drinking alone at the tavern because (insert reason). This lone drinker has no backstory, name, look, personality, or even reason for being there other than making sure the tavern isn’t empty. So we present to you: A Pub Called Quest. Quest is a tavern where every NPC has a name, place in the pub, distinct 1. Relase MKX at the same time on PC as console versions. Important note: up until the minute of release it was kept a secret that High Voltage studios was working on this port. They also worked on MK9 PC which was crashing left and right due to confirmed memory leak that they never fixed. 2. They have no idea how to release a game on steam, so they broke it up to \~900Mb zip files of which the first was the "entire game" that could not funtion obviously, the rest of the packages were automatica. # COMPLEX UNIVERSES # Albion The great elven empires were shattered into remnants long ago, yet the elves remain. Kayle is a Forest Elf who has discovered her fallen people's lost magic, granting her power over nature. Morgana is a Dark Forest Elf who has chained evil, forbidden magic within her body. Ezreal is an adventuring elf presenting himself as a "handsome rogue-paladin" named Jarro Lightfeather. Ashe is a champion against oppression despite having been condemne. This is an exact CampP of a post I made yesterday that you all seemed to like but the mods removed (and then didn’t tell me why) so here you go :) (Apologies for spelling mistakes and grammar mistakes, English is not my first language :D) This is a pretty long one but I believe it’s worth it :P Me = the smexy beast writing this post EA = Entitled Aunt EK = Entitled Kid Mum = (I’ll leave you to figure that one out ;)) So a little bit of background first: Up until tonight I was part of a DnD5e group that consisted of six people (including myself) which met on r/lfg and played via roll20. The DM A Chaotic Good Cleric of Valkur A Chaotic Neutral Changling Rogue A Neutral Good Wild Sorcerer My Neutral Good (homebrew) Phoenix Warlock and, a Lone Wolf, Ranger. amp#x200B; I had thought during the time I was in the group that my tension with the only characters was only in-character. No one ever approached me till a few days ago that my resist. gtBe me gtDM for starfinder campaign gtPlayers are pretty chill, all with pretty nice backstories gtApart from one gtSpacefairer, never played DnD before gtHis backstory is he is an alcoholic and an asshole gtImagine basic bard from all the memes but with no charisma gtDon't hate on him, he hasn't played DnD before, not going to punish him gtOther players are getting tired of this guy being a drunken asshole for no reason gtIdea.jpg gtIn order to get magical. </p>
