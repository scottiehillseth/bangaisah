                            <p> Im fully entitled and accepted for joining Warface CBT, like stated on xbox.warface.com (https://xbox.warface.com). Starting today i have the option to download the Warface Closed Beta software through Insider Hub / Insider contents. When i click on "Partecipate" after a long time spinning circle i get the error "It was not possible to register with Warface. An error occurred while trying to register this content. Try again." then "Registration is taking more time than expected." (translated. How do I download Warface for free on Xbox One? When I search the store for Warface, all I find are starter packs Edit: I misread, and it was Mb/s in steam, not Mbps as I thought, just human error. I just installed speed test by ookla or whatever it called via Microsoft store, and I got a result of 4,98 Mbps download speed. That number, is by far the highest I have ever seen on this network, but when I tried to download Warface on steam, I got merely a download of about 1 Mbps, and I have no download throttle or something on. Anyone knows what's going on and maybe a possible fix. &#x200B. 
Hey guys, I've download Warface Launcher probably every month since December 2014. At first, the known white screen launcher problem appeared on my PC, also. (First time I installed it) Now, I've uninstalled it 4 months ago, after that, I reset my PC completely, deleting all my datas (including personal ones). 1 hour ago, I downloaded the new Warface Launcher, again. The login screen now came up, I logged in. Nothing happened.the screen stays still. I don't know what's wrong with that. It's time to log in and try WF on XBOX! Don't forget that we will need your feedback after and during. I have a Dell Inspiron 1564 with an i3-330 intel GMA HD/5700mhd and 4gb of ram pls suggest a few games that I can run with tweaks on this potato.

Going through a rough time right now, had to sell my ps4 to make bills (so I can't play BF1/R6) and I could really use an escape, but I have zero dollars to spend. So I've been hunting for a decent f2p (or  as that's my Steam balance) game that's a little mindless but also has a bit of depth in terms of strategy and progression. CSGO is too frustrating right now and Insurgency is really not what I'm looking for. Any suggestions? I have an OK laptop that can handle most games pretty well. Friends! The image quality and high game performance are absolutely essential for such a dynamic shooter as Warface. Completing missions with friends is most rewarding when nothing distracts you from the heated battle. We are happy to inform you about a major step forward in the development of the game’s visual aspect: now Warface supports HDR and 4K Ultra HD! https://youtu.be/ZVNi\_PNAfAk (https://youtu.be/ZVNi_PNAfAk) You can activate 4K and HDR in the game configurations.

I logged on and saw that while my Xbox was down I now have 20+ games I didn't purchase or download. They are games like Brawlhalla, Royal Realm, and Warface? Does anyone know what caused that and has Xbox made any statements regarding privacy or anything. i know this may not be like a traditional post but i'd just like to say how much of a great game Warface is, and how much of a great company CRYTEK is for developing this game and then releasing it for free, so people like me who don't have an amount of money reserved for games can play :). The experience is just overall amazing; sure, connection issues here and there, but that's because the servers (for me at least) are across the world. I like how it isn't a P2W game, you can play and still. This is my first Reddit post so sorry if I suck as this. I started playing warface on PS4 and enjoyed the game so I figured I would download it on PC. I download it and played though the tutorial but noticed how weird it felt to aim. I go into the settings and notice the lack of sensitivity options so I thought it was just not available in game so I finish the tutorial and go into settings and still nothing even close the what PS4 has. I did some poking around online and realize
